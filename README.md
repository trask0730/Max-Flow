# Max Flow Using Linear Programming
This is a repository for my first mini-project in Math 510: Linear Programming, taught by Henry Adams.

In this repository, you can find 3 files: "REPORT.pdf", "network.pdf", and "StPetersburgToMoscow.ipynb". 

I recommend reading the report first. Then, I recommend looking through the "St. Petersburg to Moscow" code with the "network" image open.

If interested, it is fun to play around with the direction of the edges. If you swap some of the directions, you may find that the maximum flow changes. 

Packages necessary to run the code:
* NumPy 
* SciPy
